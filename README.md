With over 4 years of experience in web applications and back-end systems, I am skilled at writing clean and 
maintainable code and monitoring systems. I have experience working in both small and large teams and have 
successfully launched 4 projects from scratch. I have participated in all aspects of the software development life 
cycle, including design, code reviews, testing, deployment, and production support.
